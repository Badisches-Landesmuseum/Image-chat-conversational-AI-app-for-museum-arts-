# Inspiration
A museum guide sometimes can't help you in person while he may be talking with a group of people. It is difficult to understand the history of some of the great arts and monuments by just reading the names. If we can develop an app where you can take a photo and the app understand the art and passed it to an AI chatbot where the conversation continues it will solve this problem in some extent.

# What it does
Upload a photo or take a photo of the art work , the TensorFlow model will classify the image and the result passed to a GPT-3 chatbot and the conversation continues there on, where one can ask more about the art.

# run
pip install -r requirements.txt
